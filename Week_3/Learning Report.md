### _My learning Curve_
This week was definitely the more interesting ones comapred to the previous ones. I implemented the AlexNet Paper while going through the blogs and also trained it with the Fashion MNIST Dataset.
#### Specifics of what I learnt this week
- First hands, I got a clear idea, intuiotn and visuals of what exactly is a **convolution** through some 3b1b  and why it is a very important operation in Mathematics Field in general.
- Then I understood each design choices made in CNNs from how we extract most important features to how learning is generalized in a neural network through methods like applying filters, non-linear activations, pooling etc.
- I also wanted to get into a deeper understanding of how filters work. So I did extra research on Filters. I have attached the pdf file in the folder itself.
