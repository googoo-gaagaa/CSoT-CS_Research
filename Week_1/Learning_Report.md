### What I got to learn
- I understood the intuitive idea of Newton Raphson Method. It very well paved me they way into understanding Gradient Descent. I explored more stuff like Stochastic Gradient Descent, Batch Gradient Descent. 
- I understood the basic framework of Numpy and Pandas and how ddata is handled with different cases like missing data, skewed data, different Transformation techniques, and understanding the dataset clearly before applying it.
- I explored Linear Regression and 2 regularization techniques to prevent overfitting of the line.
- I also learnt basic Exploratory Data Analysis and different ways of visualizing data. I have attached a pdf too of different methods I have seen
